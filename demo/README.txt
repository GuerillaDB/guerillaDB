# The main presentation is the jupyter notebook. 

# The powerpoint slides have no extra information value - they are just copied screenshots from the notebook in case 
# someone would have troubles viewing the notebook.

# The same can be said of a YT video in super low quality that can be 
# found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aD-hzcWF4M
